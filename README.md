# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features of the houses. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates using regression techniques on a real estate dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains features like house size, number of rooms, location attributes, and more. The target variable is the house price (a continuous value).

## Key Steps

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
* Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
* Model Training: Used regression models such as Linear Regression (and optionally others if you used them).
* Evaluation: Evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshatlamba1/House-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook `Code.ipynb` to explore data, train the model, and see results.

## Results

The model achieves an RMSE of approximately \[your final RMSE here]. This indicates the typical deviation of predicted prices from actual prices.

## Dependencies

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib / seaborn (if you have visualizations)

## Future Work

* Experiment with more complex models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
* Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
* Deploy the model using a web app or API.
